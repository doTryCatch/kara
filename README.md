This project is a Next.js web application integrated with Electron to create a desktop AI assistant.  

## Getting Started  

### 1. Start the Next.js Web App  
Navigate to the project directory and run:

npm run dev
```  

This will start the web page, which will be rendered within Electron in a desktop environment.  

### 2. Launch Electron  
Once the Next.js app is running, navigate to the `electron` directory and start Electron:

cd electron  
npm run start  
```  

This will open a pop-up with an input area where you can interact with Kara.  

## Future Plans  

This is just the initial version of Kara. In upcoming updates, Kara will become more dynamic, capable of handling tasks like researching, coding, managing other windows, and providing a better UI. Stay tuned! ðŸš€
